Wraps all cutting-edge artificial intelligence models for face detection and face recognition and automatically handles all procedures for facial recognition in the background.</p><p><code>recops</code> is an open-source and in active development project, written in Python and licensed under the <a href=https://0xacab.org/nevermind/recops/-/blob/no-masters/LICENSE.md>Do No Harm License</a>. This means that anyone can use and adapt <code>recops</code> according to the challenges of their own research. It is lightweight and is mainly based on <a href=https://www.tensorflow.org/>TensorFlow</a> and <a href=https://keras.io/>Keras</a>, that makes it very easy to install.</p><p>To learn more about the development context of the <code>recops</code> project, you can read an overview <a href=/overview/context/>here</a>.</p><hr><h2 id=developers>DEVELOPERS</h2><p>The open-source <code>recops</code> software is developed by a duo of culture jamming activists, battling the opaque and intricate apparatus of our reality, based in Athens.</p><h2 id=contact>CONTACT</h2><p>Email is the best way of contacting us.
